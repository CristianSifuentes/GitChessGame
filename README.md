Git Chess Game
===================================

I am going to propose a realistic and detailed scenario of collaborative work in a Git project for a chess game in Python, where each programmer (killer1, killer2, killer3 and killer4) contributes. The game code will include advanced programming concepts, such as classes, design patterns (e.g., state pattern), error handling, and efficient data structures.

## Scenery
### Project requirements
* A [ Git repository](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/ebook)  that all programmers work on..

* Each programmer develops a part of the game (board, pieces, movement logic, and turn control).

* Use of Git for version control, including branches, merge, conflict resolution, and error handling in commits. 

### Step 1: Repository Initialization


killer1 creates a repository in Git and uploads a basic structure.

```bash 
# killer1
git init chess-game
cd chess-game
touch README.md main.py
git add README.md main.py
git commit -m "Initial commit with basic structure"
git remote add origin https://github.com/killer1/chess-game.git
git push -u origin master

```

### Step 2: Creating branches for each part of the project

Each programmer has his branch. killer1 creates the branches and assigns tasks:


* killer1: Create the game controller.
* killer2: Deploy the dashboard.
* killer3: Implement the pieces.
* killer4: Manage the rules and the game turn.

```bash 
# killer1
git branch controller
git branch board
git branch pieces
git branch rules
git push origin controller board pieces rules
```

### Step 3: Development of each programmer

killer1 works in game controller:

```python 
# killer1 en la rama 'controller'
class GameController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = None
        self.players = []

    def start_game(self):
        self.board = ChessBoard()
        self.players = [Player("White"), Player("Black")]
        print("Game started!")

```
```bash 
git checkout controller
git add main.py
git commit -m "Game controller class with start_game method"
git push origin controller

```

killer 2 works on the Chess Board class in the board branch:
```python 
# killer2 en la rama 'board'
class ChessBoard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.grid = self.create_board()

    def create_board(self):
        return [["" for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]

    def display_board(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print(row)


```

```bash 
git checkout board
git add main.py
git commit -m "ChessBoard class with create_board and display_board methods"
git push origin board


```

killer4 manages the game rules in the rules branch:

```python 
# killer4 en la rama 'rules'
class TurnManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.turn = 0

    def next_turn(self):
        self.turn += 1
        print(f"Turn {self.turn}: Now it's {'White' if self.turn % 2 == 1 else 'Black'}'s turn")

```

```bash 
git checkout rules
git add main.py
git commit -m "TurnManager class with next_turn method"
git push origin rules
```
### Step 4: Integration of the branches

killer1 tries to merge all branches into master to integrate the game.

```bash 
git checkout master
git merge controller
git merge board
git merge pieces
git merge rules
```
Merge error between killer1 and killer3

While merging pieces, a merge conflict occurs between killer1 and killer3 in main.py:

```bash 
Auto-merging main.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in main.py

```
killer1 resolves the conflict manually in main.py (for example, by fixing duplicate lines).

```bash 
git add main.py
git commit -m "Merge conflict resolved between controller and pieces"

```

### Step 5: Testing and bug fixing


All programmers work together to fix bugs, perform tests, and make final adjustments. For example, if killer2 finds an error in the way the board is drawn:

```bash 
# killer2 corrige un bug en 'ChessBoard'
git checkout board
# Actualiza el m√©todo display_board
git add main.py
git commit -m "Fixed display_board method to properly print the chessboard"
git push origin board

```

After fixing the errors, everyone merges their branches back to master, pushing and verifying the final operation.

### Step 6: Using Advanced Git

* Rebase: If killer4 is behind on work and your branch is out of date, you can do a rebase to keep up to date:

```bash 
git checkout rules
git rebase master

```

* Stash: If killer1 has to switch branches without losing its current work:

```bash 
git stash
git checkout pieces

```
### Step 7: Project Completion
When everything is ready, killer1 merges the final branches and tags version 1.0 of the game:


```bash 
git checkout master
git merge board
git merge pieces
git merge rules
git tag -a v1.0 -m "First release of Chess Game"
git push origin --tags

```

Advanced commands

==================

To work collaboratively and efficiently with Git on a project like the Python chess game, you could use more advanced commands that allow you to perform more refined version control, manage large changes, and avoid problems during merges. Here is a list of commands, combinations and variants applied to the chess example, as well as some strategies for their use:

### 1. Cloning and initial configuration of the repository

When working as a team, the first thing is to clone the repository:


```bash 
git clone https://github.com/killer1/chess-game.git
cd chess-game

```
Additionally, it is good practice to configure your user in Git (if you haven't already):

```bash 
git config --global user.name "killer1"
git config --global user.email "killer1@example.com"

```

### 2. Working with branches

It is always good practice to work in branches for each new feature or major change, to avoid breaking the code in master.

- Create a new branch to implement a chess move (e.g. the bishop move):

```bash 
git checkout -b feature-bishop-move

```

- Push this new branch to the remote repository:


```bash 
git push -u origin feature-bishop-move

```

### 3. Add and commit changes

Once you've made changes to the code, you can selectively add and commit them:


- Check which files have been modified:

```bash 
git status

```
- Add only the files you want to commit (for example, only changes related to the bishop's movement):

```bash 
git add bishop.py
```

- Confirm the changes with a clear and descriptive message:

```bash 
git commit -m "Implemented bishop movement logic"

```

If you want to combine several steps (add and confirm at the same time):

```bash 
git commit -am "Fixed display bug in chessboard and implemented bishop movement"
```

### 4. Work with other changes (fetch, pull, rebase)

When other developers have made changes to the remote repository, you need to sync your local work with the remote changes:

- Download master changes without automatically merging:

```bash 
git fetch origin
```

- Merge remote changes to your current branch:

```bash 
git merge origin/master

```
Or, if you prefer to keep a cleaner history without having so many merge commits, you can use rebase:


```bash 
git rebase origin/master

```

This will allow you to apply your commits to remote changes in a more organized way. If conflicts arise during rebase, you can resolve them, add the resolved file, and then continue with:

```bash 
git rebase --continue

```
### 5. Resolving merge conflicts
It's inevitable that conflicts will arise at some point when you work with multiple programmers. If you are merging and a conflict appears:

```bash 
git merge feature-bishop-move


```
Git will notify you of conflicts. You can see what they are with:

```bash 
git status


```
To resolve the conflict, edit the file, remove the conflicting flags (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>) and then add the file:

```bash 
git add chess.py
```

Once resolved, you finish the merge:


```bash 
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in chess.py"

```

### 6. Stashing temporary save

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

### 7. History and review

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

### 8. Revert changes

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

### 9. Cherry-pick (Select changes)


```bash 


```


### 10. Tags and releases

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

Complete Workflow with Valid Plays

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

```bash 


```

Conclusion


These Git commands, in combination with an organized workflow, are key to collaboration on a project like the game of chess. Using branches, merge, rebase, deconfliction, and stash will allow you to maintain a clean repository, while reviewing commits and using tags help you monitor progress and versions.
